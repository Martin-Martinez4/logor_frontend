--- Long Term 

    - Finish most of frontend
    - implement Jest tests

    - API, test with postman and JSON server
    - PSQL to hold user and login information, user should have UID
    - Redis database to implement sessions

    - Edit user database to handle posts, lists, favorites
        - idea posts post should have: 
            a UID (pointer), 
            timestamp (when the post was made), 
            owner, 
            text/content, 
            number of favorites and who favorited,
            refernce UID of posts in response 

    - Figure out Neo4j for node based relationships between users
    - K cluster for reccomendations? Sounds hard
